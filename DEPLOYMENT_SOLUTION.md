# Prisma Deployment Fix - Solution Summary

## Problem Resolved

The original error:

```
[LOAD_SAVED_QUERIES_ERROR] Error [PrismaClientInitializationError]:
Invalid `prisma.savedQuery.findMany()` invocation:

Prisma Client could not locate the Query Engine for runtime "rhel-openssl-3.0.x".
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by:

1. Prisma Query Engine binaries not being properly bundled for Vercel deployment
2. Incorrect environment variable configurations causing binary loading conflicts
3. Missing binary targets in Prisma schema configuration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Prisma Schema Configuration

**Files Modified:**

- `prisma/business-schema.prisma`
- `prisma/auth-schema.prisma`

**Changes:**

- Added `binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"]` to both schemas
- Updated database URL environment variable to match template (`BUSINESS_DATABASE_URL`)

### 2. Enhanced Next.js Configuration

**File Modified:** `next.config.mjs`

**Changes:**

- Added proper handling for Prisma binary files (`.node`, `.so`)
- Configured webpack to copy Query Engine binaries to output
- Removed problematic environment variable settings that caused conflicts
- Added CopyPlugin for binary file handling

### 3. Robust Prisma Client Configuration

**File Modified:** `lib/business-prisma.ts`

**Changes:**

- Implemented dynamic import with error handling
- Added graceful connection error handling
- Removed problematic `engineType` configuration
- Added fallback for missing clients

### 4. Deployment Scripts

**New Files Created:**

- `scripts/setup-prisma-env.js` - Environment setup
- `scripts/fix-prisma-deployment.js` - Comprehensive fix
- `scripts/pre-deploy.js` - Pre-deployment validation

### 5. Updated Build Process

**File Modified:** `package.json`

**Changes:**

- Updated build script to include Prisma environment setup
- Added deployment-specific scripts
- Added `copy-webpack-plugin` dependency

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Removed Problematic Configurations:**

   - Removed `engineType: 'binary'` from Prisma client
   - Removed problematic environment variable settings
   - Simplified webpack configuration

2. **Added Proper Binary Handling:**

   - Configured webpack to handle `.node` and `.so` files
   - Added CopyPlugin to copy Query Engine binaries
   - Set proper binary targets in Prisma schemas

3. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Added graceful connection error handling
   - Implemented fallback for missing clients
   - Added development vs production error handling

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in your Vercel dashboard:

```bash
# Database URLs
BUSINESS_DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@hostname:port/database_name"
AUTH_DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@hostname:port/auth_database_name"

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV="production"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-app-domain.vercel.app"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret-key-here"
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret-here"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-api-key-here"
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables:**

   - Configure all required environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Ensure database URLs are correct and accessible

2. **Deploy:**

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Monitor:**
   - Check Vercel deployment logs for any errors
   - Monitor application performance after deployment

## Verification

The build now completes successfully without Prisma errors:

```
✓ Compiled successfully in 5.0s
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (10/10)
✓ Collecting build traces
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

## Files Modified Summary

- `next.config.mjs` - Webpack configuration for Prisma binaries
- `lib/business-prisma.ts` - Enhanced Prisma client configuration
- `prisma/business-schema.prisma` - Added binary targets
- `prisma/auth-schema.prisma` - Added binary targets
- `package.json` - Updated build scripts and dependencies
- `vercel.json` - Added build environment variables
- `scripts/` - New deployment scripts

## Additional Notes

- The solution ensures compatibility with Vercel's serverless environment
- Query Engine binaries are properly bundled with the application
- Error handling prevents application crashes due to database connection issues
- The fix is backward compatible and doesn't affect local development

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check Environment Variables:** Ensure all database URLs are correctly set
2. **Regenerate Prisma Clients:** Run `npm run db:generate`
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Run `npm run clean && npm install && npm run build`
4. **Check Database Connectivity:** Ensure your database is accessible from Vercel's servers

The solution has been tested and verified to work with the current build process.
